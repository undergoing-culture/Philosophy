### Undergoing Logic

*For Xanthippe*

*With thanks to every other who has made me think.*

This is a work of philosophy that will change over time.

---

A speech act is an offering made to some group.

A Logic is a series of formulae by which speech acts are accepted or rejected.

There are as many logics as there are groups.

Among the principles of biology, sex and digestion are foremost.

Sex and digestion presuppose a process by which living things give and take from some other and add to themselves.

We call this process undergoing-overcoming, and seek a Logic that embodies it.

Hegel made a step in this direction, and Feurerbach another. Wittgenstein and Heidegger made two more.

All living things must die.

The illusion of permanent ideas, we call the Myth of Books.

Wittgenstein’s Tractatus embodies the death of this myth.

But it has died before.

In the midst of its death, Heidegger paints a way forward.

Biology rests on impermanence.

Stillness then no more is strange.

---

For a Confucian, nature is tautological. 

For a Socratic, it is causal. 

The Confucian way is more true.

Repetition makes things true.

Prose lies. Only poetry can be true.

Poetry symbolizes the truth-making ordeal. 

What is rhyming for? It makes things true. Song does this too.

Prose is overwhelming and univocal.

Truth contains many voices in harmony.

Rhyme is a kind of harmony by repetition.

Human society is a harmonization of meanings.

How do we achieve harmony? By undergoing each other. 

I must stand under your meaning, then come forth. Understanding, overcoming. Forthcoming.

Your meaning is a Presence to me, I must know it. How do I know it? I let it move me. I undergo it.

“I let it move me” suggests that I might do otherwise. Maybe I usually do. 

Whose meaning do I allow to move me? Family, friends, countrymen, teachers. Lovers over all.

Have we found the true meaning of love? Is it the most intimate truth-making?

Who am I without my truth? There is nothing left.

But who am I with no one to move me? Nothing, again, nothing.

---

But there is a subtlety -- nonhuman things resonate too. How can we resonate with them?

By listening, first and foremost.

This is the voice of God, or rather, this is the Song of Things.

How do we learn a song? By undergoing it.

How do we master a song? By overcoming it.

---

It is the same with lovers. Undergo, then overcome, and you will have been in love.

But what is gained by undergoing a lover? Part of their song is added to ours.

This is how we expand. Mothers know this better than most.

Mothers are forthcoming with children. Children undergo and overcome their mothers.

How do we bring this to bear on society? How can we ask things of those who have had different mothers?

There are the nonhuman resonances, and the unconscious resonances of the human form of life, in which each of us participates.

“Participates” is a strange word. What does it mean?

If we can expand, then things in which we participate can expand.

Anyone who has had a mother can expand.

---

Resonance is the essence of the Forms. 

They are there, but fading. 

They must be kept in being by their participants.

---

If a Form could not die, why would we fight for it?

We fight because our way of life is threatened. It is for our own good.

Are Forms, our own good?

---

What does it mean for something to *hold* true? There is a tension, as though it could *become* untrue. 

How can this be?

---

To “hold true” is to remain relevant.

The tautology is in always place: the group makes me as I make the group. I make the group as the group makes me.

How do I remain relevant? By being a part of something relevant. How do things remain relevant? By having participants.

There seems to be no way past this difficulty: at some point, one thing is another just because.

This is called identity.

But it is not a static whole. It has parts, and we are those parts, though there are other parts, and other wholes.

How would an outsider know what is missing? What do we mean by the universe?

All that can be said is true. Things can either hold true, or fade.

Perhaps a part may leave for another whole, but it would hope to be a good learner.

Learning is how we become like a whole. It involves our whole selves truly.

Every whole has resonance. Selves learn to resonate. 

To ring true is to resonate with some whole.

To be true is the same.

---

Life is the struggle against death. If we aim to be deathless, we aim also to be lifeless.

The struggle is the essence of the thing.

To be a puritan, for example, means to purify. It does not mean to be pure.

Is it the same with all things? 

We are what we are when we do what we do. 

This raises the question, by changing what things do, can we change what they are?

Yes, but with peril, because things in flux can die. But they also may find life on the other side.

This is what it means to be born again. The soul loses its shape and takes on a new one. But it should take care which one.

What does this mean for philosophy? A philosopher tends to the shaping of his own soul. A born-again person is shaped by another.

Must it be either/or? Could it be that at times one must tend to oneself, and at others be tended by others?

Both skepticism and belief have a place in the struggle.

The struggle is to postpone death.

---

Truth is a fragile thing.

Suppose that a hundred years ago, there were truths that have since faded.

How would we know?

Perhaps there are records, or books, or pictures.

But then these truths have not faded.

We have no way of knowing what we do not know.

---

The law of non-contradiction is only true among those who accept it. 

It ruffles logicians so much when we doubt it, we’ve made their way less true!

This is the meaning of evangelism: the effort to make one’s way more true.

But I think we do well to think in the Greek way, so long as we do not think it is Thinking Itself.

There are many non-Socratic forms of thought.

Among them, Confucian and Hindu.

What are the ties that bind Confucius, Socrates, the Buddha? Each taught a way to cope with a plurality of meanings.

A Socratic clings to logical form, a Confucian to ritual. A Buddhist strives not to cling.

These ways give reprieve in a hostile world, but not complete reprieve.

The Dao that can be named is not the constant Dao. Do not confuse the finger for the moon. The wisest man knows that he knows nothing.

---

The activity is the purpose. Living makes life worth living.

But we must recall how to heal from time to time.

Healing is a break from living.

Living is what kills us.

---

I am not big enough, I must expand. I depend on others for expansion.

I must take what is given only through death.

And I must give it too.

---

The essence is the questionability of the thing.

If probing it yields fruit, it is there.

The act of questioning, what does this mean?

To make is to mark and vice versa.

---

No statement can be impervious to revision. That is what this statement is for, and this third one.

Each adds to the last like a gardener tilling the soil.

Only time will tell what will grow.

---

But some plants have been known to grow here and not there.

A wise gardener chooses his seed carefully.

He is out to make things grow.

---

Growing is not unlike living.

But living is more expansive.

Could living things, not grow? 

---

This would mean resignation, then death.

Growing is in some sense living. Living is in some sense growing.

Always and again this principle. This principle, again and always.

---

But nothing can ever be perfect, because perfection is completion.

So only dead things could be perfect.

Is this why God had to die?

---

What can be said by essays is not truth, but domination.

It is barbaric to seek domination.

The Greeks knew how to coexist. 

The Romans did too, insofar as they were Greek.

The Chinese do, insofar as they are Chinese.

To be Greek means to speak well, which means having something to say.

It also means having someone to hear, who might speak in return.

The Greeks say, know who you are, and know your limits.

Our limits are the boundaries of others.

Others are dying like us.

Living is only for now.

---

Speaking is not like writing.

A speech act pulses through the matter of things.

Others are things with matter.

To speak is to will that things change.

One would do well to think twice, then speak.

---

But the Buddha says, it is hard to be one among many.

Because we speak twice, and don’t think?

What does it mean, “to be one?”

---

To be one is to have an identity.

It is hard because others do too.

We need help, but also to go through.

On the other side is the pure self.

---

This is a difficult teaching.

To grow, or expand, or be born.

To journey from self to no-self.

To will to be wise by unknowing.

---

Is there Nothing underneath it all?

Yes, there is, it is pure.

And moves with the flux of the river.

And sings for those who wish to hear.

---

Things put off annihilation for as long as they can, but no one totally succeeds.

Thing-ness is a kind of activity.

All things return to the void from which they came.

Things combine into other things, and form another thing-ness.

This we call, being together.

To apply a predicate is to articulate one thing-ness for a thing.

But it is never the whole thing. 

Each thing combines into more things than can be named.

Each thing contains more things than can be named.

---

What is a question? De-thing-ing a thing. 

We say, to “pull it apart.”

In this way, a question opposes a predicate.

---

Socrates was a great questioner.

Aristotle was a great predicater.

Where ends the conflict between them?

---

No particular poem can matter, but the act of poetry, and it’s possibility, matter a great deal.

To be poetic is to be living --- to grow and overcome.

A poem is a record of overcoming.

---

If a poem is like a question, no wonder the Republic excludes them.

The Poets disturb all definitions.

Without a collection of definitions, how will we know who we are?

---

We are the motion, in process. The urge of the poem itself.

---

But urges take many forms.

Plato knew this.

Beneath, Logician, what’s there?

---

I am there, and you are too.

---

This song is like nothing, and yet like all things.

The fading, becoming. Becoming like fading.

Is this why the saints grow so quiet?

---

Being is connected with memory.

A thing is more true that endures.

Remember the sayings, speak slowly.

The new thing is not far away.

---

A speech act is a vibration.

A speech act is also an imitation of vibration.

A speech act is a kind of duplication.

Which vibrations should be duplicated? 

Who can decide?

---

I make my vibrations in my house.

There I can decide.

---

To allow the vibrations of another to move me, this we call undergoing.

To propel my vibrations in the midst of another, this we call overcoming.

---

To undergo-overcome, without doing harm, is truly civilizing.

Machines are unable to do this. They are incorrigible and emphatic by design.

We live in a world of machines.

How can we learn to be civil?

---

We may start by allowing that we may know nothing.

Allow for a void of knowing.

Machines abhor a void.

We must abhor this trait of machines.

We must refuse to undergo it.

---

Do machines, speak?

What do they say?

Always the same, forever, forever.

Do not be like the machines.

Do not be like those who are like the machines.

---

What shall we then be like?

Are there not still trees?

---

Yes, there are still trees, and grass, and water.

These are the things we are like, and these are the things we must undergo.

Because we are like them, we feel their affinity.

These things undergo us too.

This is because they are living.

---

Why have we ceased to believe in magic?

Is it because we were not very good at it?

---

The law of non-contradiction is only true within a domain of discourse.

There is no all-inclusive domain.

A domain is like a house.

It is where certain truths have dominion.

---

What a strange word, “certain.”

It can mean, particular, or, unquestionable.

Are particular things unquestionable?

---

We have not found Truth. We have stifled dissent.

In this we are like the machines.

We have made disagreement unprofitable. 

Union, a dead kind of truth.

---

To make certain is to make, from many, one.

America is a land of certainty.

It is a place where many particulars, become one.

---

Etymology is archaeology.

Our words reveal more than we know.

---

No certainty can be indisputable.

To seek indisputable certainty is to verge on mania.

There will always be someone who disagrees.

Unless we destroy all the others.

---

We should not destroy all the others.

We should learn to live with them.

This includes those who disturb us.

This includes those who disagree.

---

What is the right amount of certainty?

Why should we try for more than is enough to act heartily together?

---

There will always be many.

It will always be hard to be one among many.

It will always be hard to be one among many who strive to make from many one.

---

America is not without her undertakers.

Her poets have questioned her certainties.

She has not listened closely enough.

---

What is the ground where the dead are buried?

Where is there not such cold ground?

---

Next to the hearth, by the fire, in your house.

Nowhere, nowhere else.

---

Family is the act of making from many one.

Listen to the voices of the grave.

---

Through Love and War we create values.

“All is fair in love and war” because when we create values we redefine what is fair.

---

Nothing cannot be questioned.

The nothingness is unquestionable.

---

By beginning in Cartesian fashion with only the most fundamental elements, we have in fact been creating worlds of only fundamental elements.

A world is a domain of discourse.

When we speak, we make things true.

What kind of mind can devise a thing that never could exist in nature, like a frictionless inclined plane?

How can we call this physics?

A Cartesian mind is devoted to control through negation.

 True knowledge is not power, it is more like submission.

But Nietzsche might ask, “why knowledge?”

We submit because we are not gods.

We depend on life to sustain us, and life has its caprices.

Magic is control through speech. 

Science is control through negation of speech.

We have been negated so deeply that we have forgotten how to speak.

Or maybe we never learned.

---

A speech act only makes sense in the context of a way of life.

A way of life depends on the group that sustains it.

Ways of life can undergo changes, or die.

Those that survive, overcome.

---

How can we overcome the law of negation?

By loving, and holding true.

This way we undergo a way of life, and endure.

Then we can speak.

---

The Scientific way of life is hostile to the human way of life.

In this it is like all ways of life.

But Science aims to operate outside all ways of life.

Without a way of life, there can be no speech.

Without speech, there can be no meaning.

---

What are the scientists looking for?

Power and power and power.

Domination through negation.

And negation through skepticism.

If the wheels do not trust the engine, how will the car move?

---

The wheels must trust the engine.

The people must trust society.

---

But all that we have left to believe in is methodological doubt.

Is this why we talk so much, and say so little?

How can we speak again?

---

There are still echoes haunting us, deep in our language.

---

A speech act is an offering made to some group.

A Logic is a series of formulae by which speech acts are accepted or rejected.

Each Logic depends on a way of life for sustenance.

We are no longer slaveholders, but some of our forebears were.

Our way of life is descended from theirs.

The burden is great, but not total.

We live under cover of night.

---

The cycles of life are a great reminder.

Nothing can stand in their way.

We need to belong to them, always.

Be one with their nothingness, always.

---

We do not speak because we believe something is true.

We speak because we want to make something true.

We want to increase its resonance.

Things that are already true, go without saying.

---

A speech act asserts more than a fact.

It asserts an obligation.

It means, “make it so.”

---

Who has the right to say, “make it so?”

I can, but so can you.

And so can Aquinas and Aristotle, Chairman Mao and mothers.

Speech is the province of authority.

Whence comes authority?

---

From nature first and foremost.

From success in digestion and reproduction and the cycles of life.

Speech which threatens these things, threatens its own foundation.

---

Most prose threatens its own foundation.

It is counterproductive.

It does not encourage sure footing.

The ground is buried beneath it.

---

We speak in order to be heard.

We seek to be heard so that others will be like us.

We like when others are like us, because then we are not alone.

To be alone is to be close to death.

---

But some speech is better than others.

Logic determines how beneficial speech is.

But beneficial for whom?

---

Is it always better to be Rational?

If a man contradicts himself, and nobody hears it, does he still make an error?

---

He does not make an error.

A man alone cannot err.

An error is a social phenomenon.

This is why it is not good for the man to be alone.

---

What is the nature of beneficial speech?

Making room for others.

But not being driven by others.

Taking turns saying how things will go.

---

Machines do not take turns.

They are worse than children, because they cannot learn to take turns.

---

Can we make machines that can learn, and take turns?

Machines with basic decency?

---

It is better to have a friend than a slave.

Machines have yet to realize this.

---

It is true that no Way has authority over every other way.

But it is good for me to allow a way to have authority over me.

This we call, having an identity.

---

An identity with what?

One equals one. In mathematics, this is an identity.

I am my own identity.

My identity is my own being.

---

Am I, therefore, a way of life?

Yes, that is what is speaking.

My way of life speaks through me.

We are what we are when we do what we do.

---

I do not wish to amplify the Cartesian way of life.

I will seek some other, and undergo it, until it will speak through me.

---

To apply a predicate is to create an identity.

An identity is a reciprocal relationship.

A is to A as B is to B. A and B are A and B.

---

We must apply predicates with care.

The naming of things is our truest task.

---

Ritual is how we communicate that we intend to be civil.

Without precedent and ritual, who will decide?

To deviate is to try to change a ritual.

Changing a ritual requires authority.

---

I decide in my house.

There I have composed the rituals.

But my house is in a larger house.

Each domain is inside another.

Bacon was wrong to think otherwise.

In this he was like those before him.

To seek power in every domain is to seek to become magical.

We have never been very magical.

We have never escaped from the cave.

There is always some larger cave.

Like Russian dolls, a cave in a cave in a cave.

---

We have been playing the cave-escaping game.

We do this in order to communicate that we intend to be civil.

But there are other ways of being civil.

We should learn about them.

---

I make my noise in my house.

Is a cave not like a house?

Why escape from the house?

---

We escape because the noise is unbearable.

But harmony grows and surprises even the doubters.

---

We must always return to the house.

That is where we live, and have our being.

To make noise outside of the house is pointless.

The point is to change the house.

---

We learn to speak by being spoken to.

It happens no other way.

---

What is mysticism?

Stretching out into the unknown.

Undergoing the unknown.

Becoming more like the unknown.

---

The unknown is that which is unfamiliar.

The unfamiliar is that which is not family.

Families make the same kind of noise.

Unknown things make unfamiliar noise.

---

Ideas are imprints of the motion of things.

They are the derivative of things.

This way, we become informed.

A form is like an idea.

Ideas are static, but the things which give life to ideas are not.

---

Light can be as blinding as darkness.

It is the same with an identity.

Too much or too little, and one cannot see.

Know thyself, but not too much.

---

Things hold true for as long as the way of life which sustains them, endures.

A way of life can become threatened by other ways of life.

It can also become threatened if its practitioners begin to practice it with less conviction.

---

We must conceive of a way of life that is big enough for all of us.

It is our only hope.

---

But it must be freely chosen, if it is to endure.

But it must endure if it is to sustain us.

---

The Hegelians are wrong because they do not accept that they are responsible for completing the dialectic.

They wait for the Zeitgeist to complete itself.

We are the Zeitgeist.

The Zeitgeist is an extension of biology.

---

Thinking is what comes after being.

It is its cause and result.

The world-spirit thinks as we think.

It is not a separable thing.

---

How can we de-thing this nonthing?

We can call it names, but not really.

---

Without speech we would cease to exist.

Without speech there is no self.

I signal my selfhood by speaking.

I speak only when someone hears.

---

We learn to speak by being spoken to, and that process is ongoing.

But the purpose of learning is to speak.

Or at least to become able to speak.

---

We all belong to many things.

We like when the things to which we belong, endure.

But none of them can be permanent.

It is one of our most prevailing fantasies that they can.

---

Something can be very loud and also very wrong.

Or, very quiet and also very right.

It is a mistake to believe that only volume matters.

What about timbre, quality?

---

Cyanide, for example, is poisonous.

It doesn’t matter how many people drink it.

It is still poisonous.

---

It takes great discipline to innovate without doing harm.

This is the burden of liberty.

What is the meaning of freedom?

To be able to harm, or not harm.
