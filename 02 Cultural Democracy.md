### Cultural Democracy

*For the Lady of Christ’s*

“Something that is completely clean can also be completely sterile” -  *Nixon, private memorandum, 1972*

A culture is a set of predispositions, habits, and rituals shared by a group of people.

It is also a group of live bacteria in foods such as yogurt.

These definitions have much in common.

Our cultures come to us first through our mothers’ bodies.

But there are many mothers’ bodies.

Democracy is a way of organizing political life in which many people are given authority.

Do these people have authority over mothers’ bodies?

That was a way of putting it.

Bodies change over time. The study of this we call physics.

The studies of more complex bodies have other names.

One of the names for the study of political bodies is democracy.

Political bodies are always composed of human bodies.

They share similar features, like the relations of parts to wholes.

To be political is, first and foremost, to have a body, and to be part of a body.

I put my body into the larger body.

Is this sexual? Almost. Or at least, eventually.

This is being part of a culture.

This is being cultured.

Humans seem able to affect one another at a distance.

Physicists have shown that fields act at a distance.

Is this electrical? Maybe. Are our brains not electrical?

Who has not noticed a moon and sensed that somewhere another was noticing the same moon?

The art of cultivating these signals, transmitted one to another, is aesthetics.

But first we must dampen the noise.

How terrifying, to know that there are others.

Not only to know, but to feel them.

We must not slink from the terror.
