### Cultural Democracy

*For the Lady of Christ’s*

“Something completely clean can also be completely sterile” -  *Nixon, private memorandum, 1972*

A culture is a set of predispositions, habits, and rituals shared by a group of people.

It is also a group of live bacteria in foods such as yogurt.

These definitions have much in common.

Our cultures come to us first through our mothers’ bodies.

But there are many mothers’ bodies.

Democracy is a way of organizing political life in which many people are given authority.

Do these people have authority over mothers’ bodies?

That was a way of putting it.

Bodies change over time. The study of this we call physics.

The studies of more complex bodies have other names.

One of the names for the study of political bodies is democracy.

Political bodies are always composed of human bodies.

They share similar features, like the relations of parts to wholes.

To be political is, first and foremost, to have a body, and to be part of a body.

I put my body into the larger body.

Is this sexual? Almost. Or at least, eventually.

This is being part of a culture.

This is being cultured.

Humans seem able to affect one another at a distance.

Physicists have shown that fields act at a distance.

Is this electrical? Maybe. Are our brains not electrical?

Who has not noticed a moon and sensed that somewhere another was noticing the same moon?

The art of cultivating these signals, transmitted one to another, is aesthetics.

But first we must dampen the noise.

---

How terrifying, to know that there are others.

Not only to know, but to feel them.

We must not slink from the terror.

---

We must stop deceiving our children with the lie that they choose who they are.

When we tell them this, we are making them into something.

We should consider whether it is what we want them to be.

But if not freedom, then what?

A culture is not chosen. It is continued.

Becoming informed by a culture is always painful. But it need not be made more painful.

Culture comes to us first through our mothers' bodies.

Later, it comes through food, rituals, and sex.

We do choose whether or not to engage in these things. But we do not choose which of them will resonate with us.

If we lose touch with the things that resonate with us, we begin to fade.

It is not good to fade.

The culture of freedom pretends to be chosen. It even demands it.

But what other choice did most of us have?

We continue it, so that we will not fade.
