### Cultural Limitations

*For the Lady of Christ’s*

“Something completely clean can also be completely sterile” -  *Nixon, private memorandum, 1972*

---

A culture is a set of predispositions, habits, and rituals shared by a group of people.

It is also a group of live bacteria in foods such as yogurt.

These definitions have much in common.

Our cultures come to us first through our mothers’ bodies.

But there are many mothers’ bodies.

Democracy is a way of organizing political life in which many people are given authority.

Do these people have authority over mothers’ bodies?

---

That was a way of putting it.

Bodies change over time. The study of this we call physics.

The studies of more complex bodies have other names.

One of the names for the study of political bodies is democracy.

Political bodies are always composed of human bodies.

They share similar features, like the relations of parts to wholes.

To be political is, first and foremost, to have a body, and to be part of a body.

I put my body into the larger body.

Is this sexual? Almost. Or at least, eventually.

This is a part of being a culture.

This is being cultured.

---

Humans seem able to affect one another at a distance.

Physicists have shown that fields act at a distance.

Is this electrical? Maybe. Are our brains not electrical?

Who has not noticed a moon and sensed that somewhere another was noticing the same moon?

The art of cultivating these signals, transmitted one to another, is aesthetics.

But first we must dampen the noise.

---

How terrifying, to know that there are others.

Not only to know, but to feel them.

We must not slink from the terror.

---

We must stop deceiving our children with the lie that they choose who they are.

When we tell them this, we are making them into something.

We should consider whether it is what we want them to be.

But if not freedom, then what?

A culture is not chosen. It is continued.

Becoming informed by a culture is always painful. But it need not be made more painful.

Culture comes to us first through our mothers' bodies.

Later, it comes through food, rituals, and sex.

We do choose whether or not to engage in these things. But we do not choose which of them will resonate with us.

If we lose touch with the things that resonate with us, we begin to fade.

It is not good to fade.

The culture of freedom pretends to be chosen. It even demands it.

But what other choice did most of us have?

We continue it, so that we will not fade.

---

People are so often not on the same page.

Are they even in the same book?

---

Kant says that the only moral law is to allow each individual to express his or her autonomous will.

But where do these wills come from?

Surely from our bodies.

Surely from our cultures.

How else would individuals know what to want?

I want to be an autonomous individual, like everyone else.

---

Moralities are enforced through punishment.

We punish those who are not individual enough.

But what about family?

---

Families make the same kind of noise.

We need to be near those who make familiar noise, because otherwise we fade.

A family can be made from autonomous individuals, but something is missing.

What is missing is the recognition of similarity.

---

We are made similar by the absorption of culture.

Does culture exist at the level of micro-organisms?

In yogurt it does.

Are we made similar by sharing yogurt?

---

This is just one example.

We are certainly made similar through sex.

---

What if the yogurt goes bad?

Will the reaction in my gut affect my will?

Yes, it surely will.

---

Those who have better yogurt will have better bodies and minds.

Perhaps this is usually better left unsaid.

We don’t want to arouse the anger of those who have had bad yogurt, through no fault of their own.

One cannot put new yogurt into old yogurt cups.

---

But what if we *do* put new yogurt into old yogurt cups?

---

The point of life is to blossom, and to thrive. 

To spread our influence, and to make that influence endure.

The best way to make influence endure is to genuinely benefit others.

---

The culture of freedom has many benefits, but it does not leave much room for influencing others.

So then what is life for?

---

Moral purity is not an end in itself.

It is at best a means of increasing our capacity to benefit others.

---

Roman law promises power that can never exist for humans.

It is the power of making a decree that is valid always and everywhere.

Human laws are contingent.

Thinkers in the early modern period began to notice this.

They said that power derives from the consent of the governed.

But this is only part of the story.

No amount of voting can make men immortal, or less dependent on food.

Power may be maintained by the consent of the governed, but it derives from nature.

In particular, from biological processes.

---

I reject the idea that nature is ruthless.

Humans are ruthless. Nature is very lazy. 

Nature is only ruthless when threatened.

If humans are often ruthless, it is only because they are often threatened.

---

I think we are in a dark age.

The difference between a dark age and a light age is that nobody in the future will look to the dark age as an example.

I cannot recommend looking to us as an example.

We do not know what we are doing.

---

We must try to know what we are doing.

How can we find an example?

There have been light ages, but their examples blind us.

We may not adjust well to their light.

We must look for examples that meet us where we are.

Or can we become such examples?

---

How can we become such examples?

By returning to fundamentals.

By encountering plants and animals.

By gardening.

---

All good examples move carefully.

This is a test of goodness.

The thrill of annihilation is barbaric.

Good examples are not barbaric.

---

Good examples cultivate society like a garden.

They dislike weeds as much as barbarians.

---

Since the discovery of the New World, one of the dominant modes of power in Western Europe has been Giver of Gifts from Afar.

Those with more foreign gifts have had more power.

Perhaps we are stretched too thin, “like butter spread over too much bread.”

We could make do with more butter or less bread.

---

This mode of power is even more prevalent in the New World itself.

---

The chief virtue in a liberal society is humility.

One cannot know what another values.

Are there simply too many values?

---

But are we to value liberalism? Or liberty? Or life and the pursuit of happiness?

How should we treat those who do not value these things?

Should we educate them? Punish them? Tolerate them?

Each path has its advantages.

---

We should culture with them.

We should adapt to them, and hope that they likewise adapt to us.

We should evolve together.

---

But we should recognize some limitations.

---

Aristotle was wrong to project human reasoning onto the cosmos.

The cosmos is not rational.

Only humans are rational.

Reasoning is a human activity.

---

Then, what is the cosmos?

It is chaos. 

But this cannot be. The cosmos is stable.

Then it is a collection of balanced opposites.

---

The interplay of opposites, we call culture.

It is well that these forces have a common ancestor.

That is why they can harmonize.

---

Reasoning is one kind of culture. It is not unique to humans, though humans are skilled at it.

Reasoning cannot transcend life.

Reasoning depends on life.

---

For centuries, mystics have claimed that ultimate reality is unknowable.

No doubt we will continue ignoring them.

---

Many humans believe that they have control over their lives.

I doubt this, but the belief is important.

Without it, we may not survive.

---

What does belief offer us?

A shared cooperative framework.

An understanding of which behaviors are permitted and which are punished.

Without these, there could be no cities.

---

Aristotle’s folly, and ours, lies in seeking a universal belief.

There can never be any such thing.

Logic is in the mind, if we’re lucky.

It can never be anywhere else.

---

Perhaps it would be better to call this Alexander’s folly.

Belief spread by the sword.

---

There is a cooperative spirit in humans more magnificent than in any other animal.

This is enabled by belief in a common cause.

But whose cause?

---

The cultural marxists think they can do away with belief.

How will they feel when we stop believing in their cause?

---

The meritocrats believe in ambition alone.

Does this not uproot all belief?

---

The cause must be cooperative.

It doesn’t matter whose it is.

It also must sustain us.

The cause cannot transcend life.
